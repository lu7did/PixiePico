    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ham radio is a technical hobby enjoyed by millions of persons worldwide, despite different country specific definitions the overall characterization is about activities performed by individuals interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand telecomunications operating procedures.\n",
    "* Perform technical studies.\n",
    "* Experiment with electronics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ham radio operators uses communcations gear  both home made and commercially made alike. Depending on the technical skills of the operator she might be able to build from relatively simple to very sophisticated gear, the availblity of commercial equipment allows for persons with strong interest in the communications side of the activity to have access to sophisticated equipment as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As technology advances the ability for relatively novel people to craft their own equipment fades away as it requires a substantial footprint of knowledge, tools and lab equiptments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still there are opportunities, some of them offered as kits, of relatively simple to medium complexity equipments to be built by beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "As anybody with some mileage expended in the hobby might testify there is no thrill greater than to build and equipment with our own hands and *communicate* with it thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ham radio communications spans over a large number of modes, both analog and digital, as well as a significant number of bands, essentially from very large long wave radio frequencies to very tiny microwave frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still the frequencies commonly referred as *HF* brings the appeal of allowing very long distance communications with relatively simple antenas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the 28 Mhz (10 meter band) allow a worldwide communication capability with antennas which can be acommodated even on very restricted facilities using relatively low powers (1W or less).\n",
    "\n",
    "A new generation of small signal digital communication modes allows extremely very low power and relatively simple transceivers to allow state of the art digital communications. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aim for the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an extremely simple yet capable HF transceiver for the 28 MHz band able to withstand small signal digital communications in real conditions.\n",
    "* Use as many low cost and readily available parts and kits to build it.\n",
    "  * Pixie 7 MHz CW transceiver kit.\n",
    "  * rp2040 breakout board.\n",
    "  * Si5351 clock breakout board.\n",
    "* Allow the builder to grow and extend technical skills in a number of domains while building it, such as:\n",
    "  * Basic understanding of the design of the different stages and sub-systems of the transceiver.\n",
    "  * Use of a ARM processor development environment and build chain\n",
    "  * Operate the transceiver with state-of-the-art communications software such as WSJT-X and others.\n",
    "  * Notions of 3D printing design techniques.\n",
    "  * Simple radio station setup procedures.\n",
    "  * Minimum test equipment and building techniques.  \n",
    "* On-the-air evaluation of the transceiver and few operating techniques associated with it.\n",
